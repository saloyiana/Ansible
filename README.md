# Ansible 

## What you will find in this repo? 

In this repo, I created a docker image with ansible installed on it since I don't prefer installing it on my machine. If you do not prefer that as well, all you have to do is to `clone` this repo then `run make` up .. and then start playing around with ansible.  

Otherwise, run `./install.sh` to install ansible locally, to verfiy the installtion run `./verification.sh`
